> ### Angular project containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc).

# ![Angular Forum App](logo.png)


### [Demo](http://hamidihamza.com/angular-forum)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged application built with Angular that interacts with an actual backend server including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.


# Getting started

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally. 

We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use Yarn. you can install it from [Here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install), then run `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

Or, you can use npm the default package manager of NodeJs & install the dependencies with `npm install`.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building the project
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.


## Functionality overview

The example application is a social blogging site (i.e. a Medium.com clone). You can view a live demo over at http://hamidihamza.com/angular-forum/
